# Scorecard App
An app I made to learn Ruby on Rails.

## Dependencies
download these first with whatever package manager you want
- ruby-3.0.3
- mysql (make sure its running too)
- node

download these with given commands
- yarn (npm install --global yarn) 
- rails-6.1 (gem install rails -v 6.1)
- bundler (gem install bundler)

## Set up
in the apps parent directory, run the following:
- 'bundle install'
- 'yarn install'
- 'rails db:create'
- 'rails db:migrate'
- 'rails db:seed'
- 'rails s'

this should get the app up and running on localhost:4000

- Now go to http://localhost:4000 to get started!
