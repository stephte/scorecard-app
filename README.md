# Scorecard App
A sample app I used to learn Ruby on Rails.

#Dependencies
- ruby-3.0.3
- mysql
- yarn
- bundler

#Set up
in the parent directory, run the following:
- 'yarn install'
- 'bundle install'
- 'rails db:create'
- 'rails db:migrate'
- 'rails db:seed'
- 'rails s'

this should get the app up and running on localhost:4000

- Now go to http://localhost:4000 to get started!
